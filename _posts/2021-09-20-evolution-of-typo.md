Fashion has become a huge part of our daily lives and continues to evolve time and time again. In this current day and age, fashion has diverged into many fields and each component has developed its own importance, for example, sneakers.

 To be very direct, there is one type of sneakers that is seen as ‘a classic that evokes nostalgia and connects generations.’ The Air Jordans. These unique trainers have quickly turned into a storm of a trend but some people forget it’s rich history and as to why it is trending now.

 Shoes were just shoes a long time ago until Nike released a pair of basketball shoes. It was at that moment the Air Jordans were made.
