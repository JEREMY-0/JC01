The world of Anime is vey complex and as each day passes, more and more people are trying it out and end up getting hooked on it. There are countless anime shows that interest a wide ranged audience. Some see anime to be a childish concept which has no difference to normal cartoons, but others have acknowledged anime and even let it become a huge part of their lives.  Even now, anime has become such a trendy genre that people are starting to show their love for it through clothing.

In the past years, anime was just something to be watched and admired, but now it has become a great opportunity and an amazing idea for conglomerates to utilise and one of these great ideas is to combine certain animes and clothing together. An example of this is in the picture above which consists of a black top that has a character from the dragon Ball super anime which is considered to be one of the greatest animes of all time.<https://reelrundown.com/animation/top-10-most-popular-anime-of-all-time>

Furthermore, the shirt displayed is unique in the sense that it shares the same typeface as the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. This is done in order to widen their target audience for both basketball and dragon ball fans.
