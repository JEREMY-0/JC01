 Hello. My name is Jeremy Christopher and welcome to JC World. On this website, you will be able to explore the different concepts and ideas of specific fashion features. From time to time, I will upload some of my views on what is trending fashion-wise and you are more than free to discuss your thoughts with me. I will try to cover as much as I can and post regularly. 

I would describe myself to be a very curious and attentive person. I have noticed that wherever I go, there are certain types of clothing that people tend to wear more often and I question why. My first article is about the famous Air Jordan 1 sneakers. Not only do I like the design of the shoes but the logo strikes me more. This is because the shoes consists of both the iconic 'jumpman' logo and the Air Jordans wing logo. The typography is different in their own way but is also unique. The winged logo has hidden meaning which you can find out in the article but overall, clothing branding and its typography hold deep meaning behind it. This is what drove me to create this website. I am also reaching out for others who have the same passion and want to discuss trendy and exciting topics.
