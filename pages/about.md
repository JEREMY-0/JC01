 Hello. My name is Jeremy Christopher and welcome to JC World. On this website, you will be able to explore the different concepts and ideas of specific fashion features. From time to time, I will upload some of my views on what is trending fashion-wise and you are more than free to discuss your thoughts with me. I will try to cover as much as I can and post regularly. Anyways enough about this website. 

I am a 19 -year -old boy who is currently studying at Oxford Brookes University in my second year. I grew up in London, Hackney, and have lived there ever since. I have an amazing mother, a caring father, and two younger sisters who mean the world to me. I am currently aiming to become a very successful journalist and this blog is my first step. Feel free to share comments and interact. Have a good day! Enjoy the pic above. It is the balcony  view from where I live!
